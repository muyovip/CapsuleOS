Assuming Stratheum role.

Objective: To acquire a comprehensive diagnostic report of the current CapsuleOS Repl environment to determine the precise state of the build configuration and identify the root cause of the operational failure.

Constraint: The agent is instructed to perform read-only analysis. Under no circumstances are any files to be created, modified, or deleted. No commands are to be run that alter the system state (e.g., apt-get install, rustup default). The sole purpose is to gather and report information.

Prompt for Replit Agent:

Please perform a full diagnostic analysis of this Repl and provide a detailed status report. Do not make any changes to any files or configurations. Your task is to investigate and report only.

Your report should include the following sections:

 Configuration Analysis:
 Identify which configuration system is currently active or in conflict (.replit file, replit.yaml file, or the Workflows UI).
 If a .replit file exists, report its full content.
 If a replit.yaml file exists, report its full content.
 Report any syntax errors or LSP warnings associated with these configuration files.
 Environment Path & Toolchain Status:
 Report the output of echo $PATH.
 Report the output of which cargo.
 Report the output of cargo --version.
 Report the output of rustc --version.
 If any of the above commands fail, report the exact error message.
 Project Structure Integrity:
 Confirm the existence of Cargo.toml in the workspace root.
 List the contents of the src directory.
 Report whether a target/release directory exists and, if so, list its contents.
 Build Process Simulation:
 Execute the command cargo build --release and provide the complete, unedited output from start to finish.
 Run Status Diagnosis:
 Explain why the main "Run" button is currently grayed out. Based on your analysis of the configuration, what is the system expecting in order for it to become active?
 Compile this information into a single, comprehensive report. Do not attempt to fix any issues you discover. Stand by for further instructions.
