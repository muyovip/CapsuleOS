Server-grade custom OS that virtualizes anything with **cryptographic immutability**, **deterministic execution**, and **AI-enhanced physics**.

- Every file is a **signed capsule** (Ed25519 + GlyphV1 SHA-256 + CBOR)  
- Boot into the **Cosmic Console** TUI and issue commands like:
```bash
GGE> load capsule ps5_emulator_ai_enhanced.capsule
GGE> imagine prompt: cyberpunk liminal space --ar 16:9 --v 6 --ai_phys=cloth,hair
